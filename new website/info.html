<p> History

OnePlus One
OnePlus was founded on 17 December 2013 by former Oppo vice-president Pete Lau and Carl Pei.[7]
 According to Chinese public records, OnePlus' only institutional shareholder is Oppo Electroni
 cs.[4] Lau denied that OnePlus was a wholly owned subsidiary of Oppo and stated that Oppo Elec
 tronics and not Oppo Mobile (the phone manufacturer) is a major investor of OnePlus and that th
 ey are "in talks with other investors",[8] although OnePlus has confirmed it uses Oppo's manufa
 cturing line and shares part of the supply chain resources with Oppo.[9] The company's maingoal
 was to design a smartphone that would balance high-end quality with a lower price than otherph-
 ones in its class, believing that users would "Never Settle" for the lower-quality devices pro-
 duced by other companies. Lau explained that "we will never be different just for the sake of a
 being different. Everything done has to improve the actual user experience in day-to-day use.he
 also showed aspirations of being the "Muji of the tech industry", emphasizing its focus on high
 -quality products with simplistic, user-friendly designs.[10] Continuing Lau's associative with
 the platform from the Oppo N1,[11] OnePlus entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with
 Cyanogen Inc. to base its products' Android distribution upon a variant of the popular custom a
 ROM CyanogenMod and use its trademarks outside of China.[12][13]</p>
